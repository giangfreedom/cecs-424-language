my experience with fortran 77

   it takes me a while to get fortran compiler and i can only found
   the 90 once since it is the only one that people
   actually do tutorial and most IDE use.
   
   However, i coded my program follow the 77 guideline
   at first it was some what confusing, i actually think
   that i need to put the word CONTINUE next to each column label
   turn out it isn't and i have to fix my entire program
   using a do while loop.

   I did not do the sorting part just get 20 number from user and
   check the array to see, whether the target is there or not.
   when i finish the program it looks some what easy,
   however i spend a lot of time doing such easy thing.
